# 🤝 Consulting & Collaboration

I help teams turn messy data into clean, easy-to-use dashboards.

If your organization struggles with:
- Reports that take too long to build  
- Decisions being made from spreadsheets  
- Manually copying/pasting numbers every week  
- Not having clear insight into performance  
- No unified "single source of truth"

I can help by building dashboards that:
- Show key metrics in one place  
- Update automatically from your data sources  
- Reduce manual work and reporting time  
- Help decision makers understand opportunities and risks
